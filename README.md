## AWS AugmentAbility

***This is an experimental fork of the [AWS AugmentAbility project](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/use-aws-ai-and-ml-services-to-foster-accessibility-and-inclusion-of-people-with-a-visual-or-communication-disability/) in which some of the vision capabilities have been re-implemented to leverage multi-modal Generative AI models through Amazon Bedrock instead of Amazon Rekognition.***

**AWS AugmentAbility** is a mobile web app which showcases 5 AWS AI/ML services (Amazon Transcribe, Amazon Translate, Amazon Polly, **Amazon Bedrock** and Amazon Textract) and, at the same time, provides features that may benefit people with a visual or communication impairment, including difficulties in reading written text (text recognition), hearing (live transcription), speaking (text-to-speech), or having a conversation in a foreign language (voice-to-voice live translation).

### Main features
* **Live transcription & text-to-speech**: the app transcribes conversations and speeches for you, in real-time. Can't speak? Type what you want to say, and the app will say it for you. This feature is currently available in Arabic, Catalan, Chinese, Czech, Danish, English (Australia, UK, India, New Zealand, South Africa, US), Finnish, French (France, Canada), German (Germany, Switzerland), Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese (Portugal, Brazil), Romanian, Russian, Spanish (Spain, US), and Swedish.
* **Live transcription & text-to-speech with translation**: the app transcribes and translates conversations and speeches for you, in real-time. Can't speak? Type what you want to say, and the app will translate and say it for you. Translation currently available in 75+ languages.
* **Real-time Conversation Translation**: select a target language, speak in your own language, and the app will translate what you say in the target language. This feature is currently available in Arabic, Catalan, Chinese, Czech, Danish, English (Australia, UK, India, New Zealand, South Africa, US), Finnish, French (France, Canada), German (Germany, Switzerland), Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese (Portugal, Brazil), Romanian, Russian, Spanish (Spain, US), and Swedish.
* ðŸ†• **Scene description and Visual Q&A**: take a picture with your smartphone, and the app will describe the objects around you by leveraging Anthropic Claude 3 Haiku's vision capabilites via Amazon Bedrock. If you enable <b>Q&A mode</b>, the app will also be able to answer your questions based on what's around.
* **Text extraction from documents**: point your camera at any full-page document, and the app will read it out loud for you. AugmentAbility can also translate the text into 75+ languages, or make it more readable for users with dyslexia by leveraging the OpenDyslexic font.

### Deployment options

#### Preconditions: enable access to Anthropic Claude 3 Haiku in Amazon Bedrock in your region of choice
Follow the steps described in [this web page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-access-modify.html) to enable access to Anthropic Claude 3 Haiku in Amazon Bedrock in your region of choice

#### Option 1: building and deploying AWS AugmentAbility to the AWS Amplify Console

Follow the steps described in [this blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/use-aws-ai-and-ml-services-to-foster-accessibility-and-inclusion-of-people-with-a-visual-or-communication-impairment/)

ðŸ†• At Step 1.1, manually download the template available at [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws-samples/aws-augmentability/refs/heads/bedrock/template.yml), navigate to [this web page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=eu-central-1#/stacks/new?stackName=augmentability-bedrock-stack), choose `Upload a template file` and upload the template.yml file. At Step 2.1, clone the repository from [this link](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-augmentability/tree/bedrock).

#### Option 2: building and deploying AWS AugmentAbility locally

 1. Follow Step 1 and 2 (Create the Amazon Cognito user pool and identity pool, and grant permissions for accessing AWS AI services; Clone the GitHub repository and edit the configuration file) from [this blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/use-aws-ai-and-ml-services-to-foster-accessibility-and-inclusion-of-people-with-a-visual-or-communication-impairment/)

 ðŸ†• At Step 1.1, manually download the template available at [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws-samples/aws-augmentability/refs/heads/bedrock/template.yml), navigate to [this web page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=eu-central-1#/stacks/new?stackName=augmentability-bedrock-stack), choose `Upload a template file` and upload the template.yml file. At Step 2.1, clone the repository from [this link](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-augmentability/tree/bedrock).


 2. run `npm install` (only first time)
 3. run `npm install --global local-web-server` (only first time)
 4. run `npm run-script build` (only first time, or in case of changes to JavaScript code)
 5. run `ws`
 6. Before accessing the app for the first time, you have to set a new password for the user that has been automatically created during Step 1. You can find the link to the temporary login screen in the Outputs tab for the CloudFormation stack (field UserPoolLoginUrl). For this first sign-in, you use the user name you set up and the temporary password you received via email. After you set your new password, youâ€™re ready to test the mobile web app by opening the index.html file in a browser.
