#### Option 1: building and deploying AWS AugmentAbility to the AWS Amplify Console

Follow the steps described in [this blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/use-aws-ai-and-ml-services-to-foster-accessibility-and-inclusion-of-people-with-a-visual-or-communication-impairment/)


#### Option 2: building and deploying AWS AugmentAbility locally

 1. Follow Step 1 and 2 (Create the Amazon Cognito user pool and identity pool, and grant permissions for accessing AWS AI services; Clone the GitHub repository and edit the configuration file) from [this blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/use-aws-ai-and-ml-services-to-foster-accessibility-and-inclusion-of-people-with-a-visual-or-communication-impairment/)
 2. run `npm install` (only first time)
 3. run `npm install --global local-web-server` (only first time)
 4. run `npm run-script build` (only first time, or in case of changes to JavaScript code)
 5. run `ws`
 6. Before accessing the app for the first time, you have to set a new password for the user that has been automatically created during Step 1. You can find the link to the temporary login screen in the Outputs tab for the CloudFormation stack (field UserPoolLoginUrl). For this first sign-in, you use the user name you set up and the temporary password you received via email. After you set your new password, youâ€™re ready to test the mobile web app by opening the index.html file in a browser.
